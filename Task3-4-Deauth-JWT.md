# Task 3.4 - JWT De-authorization

This document outlines the steps taken to remove JWT authentication from the API endpoints for easier frontend development.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Authentication from User Routes
Modified `movie_api/mongodb/routes/userRoutes.js` to remove JWT authentication middleware from all protected routes.

### 2. Cleaned Up index.js
Removed Passport.js configuration and authentication middleware from `movie_api/mongodb/index.js`.

### 3. Disabled Passport.js
Commented out the entire `movie_api/mongodb/passport.js` file.

## Implementation Status

✅ Successfully removed JWT authentication from all endpoints
✅ Maintained data validation (e.g., password complexity)
✅ Confirmed MongoDB Atlas connection is working
✅ All endpoints are now accessible without authentication tokens

## Git Commands Used

```bash
# Check current branch
git status

# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "feat: remove authentication from all endpoints for frontend development"

# Push to Heroku
git push heroku feat/remove-auth-from-movies-endpoint:main

# Restart Heroku app
git push heroku feat/remove-auth-from-movies-endpoint:main
```

## Testing the API

### Successful Test Request
```bash
# Create a new user (no JWT token required)
curl -X POST https://myflix2-54ee4b2daeee.herokuapp.com/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "testuser1",
    "password": "Testpass123!",
    "email": "test1@example.com",
    "birthday": "1990-01-01"
  }'
```

### Example of Validation Still Working
```bash
# This will fail due to password validation
curl -X POST https://myflix2-54ee4b2daeee.herokuapp.com/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "testuser2",
    "password": "simplepassword",
    "email": "test2@example.com",
    "birthday": "1990-01-01"
  }'
# Response: {"errors":[{"type":"field","msg":"Password must contain a special character"}]}
```

## MongoDB Atlas Configuration

To ensure proper connectivity:
1. Log in to [MongoDB Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com/)
2. Go to Network Access under Security
3. Add the following IP to the whitelist:
   - `0.0.0.0/0` (for development)
   - Or specific Heroku IP ranges for production

## Verifying the Deployment

1. Check Heroku logs for successful connection:
   ```bash
   heroku logs --tail
   ```
   Look for: `Connected to MongoDB`

2. Test endpoints without authentication:
   ```bash
   # Get all users
   curl https://myflix2-54ee4b2daeee.herokuapp.com/users

   # Get movies
   curl https://myflix2-54ee4b2daeee.herokuapp.com/movies
   ```

## Notes
- Authentication has been completely removed from all endpoints
- Data validation is still enforced
- The API is now in an open state for frontend development
- For production, consider re-enabling authentication with proper CORS and rate limiting
