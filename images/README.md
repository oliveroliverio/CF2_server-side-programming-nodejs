# Images Directory

This directory contains local copies of all images used in the markdown documentation.

The directory structure is organized as follows:
- `auth/` - Authentication and authorization related images
- `ui/` - User interface screenshots and examples
- `icons/` - Icons and small graphics
- `diagrams/` - Architectural diagrams and flowcharts
- `avatars/` - User avatars and profile pictures
- `misc/` - Miscellaneous images that don't fit other categories

This local storage approach ensures that all images persist even if external URLs break.
